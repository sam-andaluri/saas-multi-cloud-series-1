## Overview

The terraform modules were written to be part of a series of projects published by Manning. 
The concept of the series is "Architecting Multi-Cloud SaaS Applications".

## Contents

Currently this repo contains Terraform modules for AWS and GCP. 
Most of the work is of my own, some borrowed from examples in documentation and blog posts.
Code is tested and I use this code for my work as well as experimentation.

Currently code exists in series specific repositories to make it easier for users.
