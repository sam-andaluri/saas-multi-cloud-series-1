## Infrastructure as Code

This folder will contain terraform scripts to create resources needed for this series. For Kubernetes, the supplied code only provides cluster creation. I did not supply ingress resources, for the reason that there are many ingress controllers to choose from. Besides AWS default Application Load Balancer ingress is going thru evolution of its own. There are other ingress controllers such as Ambassador and Nginx provides far simpler installation and configuration.
